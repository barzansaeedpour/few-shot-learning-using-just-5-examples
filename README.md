# Few-Shot Learning with Only 5 Images

This repository explores the concept of few-shot learning, a subfield of machine learning, where the goal is to learn new tasks or recognize new classes with only a small number of training examples.

## Overview
Few-shot learning is a challenging problem in machine learning, as traditional algorithms require a large amount of labeled data to achieve good performance. However, in real-world scenarios, it is often impractical or costly to collect a large labeled dataset for every new task or class. Few-shot learning aims to address this limitation by enabling models to generalize from a small number of labeled examples.

In this repository, we demonstrate the feasibility of few-shot learning using only 5 images. By leveraging transfer learning and state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, we showcase how a model can be trained to recognize new classes with minimal training data.
